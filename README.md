# EmPath
 
em.Path is an immersive sim where you travel across a surreal and glitched world in your RV. You play as <b>Em</b>, a novice witch who has traded her memories for magical power.

<h2>Live by the road</h2>
Maintain and refuel your trusty RV, pick up lone travelers at gas stations and listen to their bizarre stories. Get lost in a maze of <i>unliminal spaces</i> and be dwarfed by impossibly tall buildings. Upgrade your camper and reach the <i>Fragments of Creation</i> hovering in outer space.
Hike to enigmatic temples lost in the woods and set up a camp, work as a hitgirl for the local fuel cartel, rent a truck and transport ICBMs coast to coast or just shoplift from any gas station you encounter, the Road is full of opportunities.

<h2>Bullet hell meet boomer shooter</h2>
Numbers don't lie, and the spell <b>DISASTER </b>for your enemies! Combine over <b>200 spells</b> to create over <b>20,000 combinations</b>. Want a bouncing fireball that summons a goblin with each bounce? You got it! Craving a freezing wind that melts the bones of your enemies? We at <b>Esoteric Heavy Industries</b> have a grimoire for that. Sacrifice VHS tapes and lost media to add new properties to your spells. Keep mixing them to create a transcendent spell that will break the entire game's logic, but beware: the <i>Surviving Gods</i> don't like hubris and amateur witches messing with the very laws of nature.


<h2>Class struggle</h2>
You starting class will slowly change by doing activities reserved for other classes, you can create hybrid classes and unlock combined abilities.
<b>Witch</b>
Has access to a flying broom and can fire spells with her gun.
<b>CEO</b>
Capitalism, ho! MP is now replaced by cash. Buy companies and mass produce grimoires, hire researchers, and advance the study of magic.
<b>Wrestler</b>
Pummel your enemy to cast spells! Deflect incoming projectiles with your chiseled abs.
<b>Fishergirl</b>
You have a random chance of fishing any item in the game, you can complete the entire game just by fishing.
<b>Cultist</b>
Literally the spy from Team fortress 2, but meaner.

<h2>Parkour</h2>
See that wall? You can climb it. As long as you're facing a wall, you can keep jumping and wall-running, adjusting your trajectory with the vector gun's recoil and potentially breaking the movement system with bunnyhopping.

<h2>Realpolitik</h2>
Get entangled with the politics of the magical society: discuss the nature of the soul with <b>Sir Aleister Crowley</b>, have a tea with your patron <b>Lady Margaret Thatcher</b>, get your proposal vetoed by <b>Baba Yaga</b>, establish 4 hours workday applied to the entire world with the enchantress <b>Circe</b>.
Exhange favours or threats to gain votes in the Mage Guild council.

<h2>Who broke the world?</h2>
The millenium bug has fried most of technology and a future apocaliptic event that will occur on December 21st, 2012, is retroactively rewring history, breaking the world beyong repair and merging baseline reality with fragments of the 92 outer dimensions.
Time is also broken and localized time loops have started to appear, the only way to advance your reference frame and escape a time loop is to move over 80 km/h, easily reachable with your RV.
